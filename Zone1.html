<!--The following code as a whole loads. When the page loads, the second piece of script runs which places the root url into the head tags of the html.
 At the end of the url it tells the function list events to run. List events pulls the feed from the root and then parses
 it down to each individual cell. It converts the context of that cell into an html/browser friendly format. It then places this altered text within the
 title tag, thus changing the title of the page and the tab name. Every three seconds the second script runs, replacing the url in the head tags, and running the
 list events function again.-->
